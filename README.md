Ace Editor Plugin for Mecha CMS
===============================

> Replace your default source code editor with Ace!

Upload the `__ace` folder along with its contents through the plugin uploader. You need to compress the folder into a ZIP file to simplify the uploading process. After that, go to the plugin manager page and follow the instructions on the **About** tab.
